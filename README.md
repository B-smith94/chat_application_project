Welcome to my Chat Application Project! This application utilizes WebSocket protocols for faster, bi-directional communication between client and server.

### Table of Contents:

1. Login Page
2. Chat Page

## 1. Login

Here you enter the name you wish to be displayed to others in the chat. It must be at least 6 characters long. Once you've entered in a display name (or Username), you will be redirected to the chat page.

## 2. Chat Page

Above is what the Chat page will look like when you first enter.  Once you and anyone else in the chat room have entered in a message, it will look like this:

The Timestamp of each message will be displayed on the opposite side of each text box from the message itself.  Each message will also be labeled and color-coded according to who sent it. Your messages will be blue and on the left side of the box, while others' messages will be green and aligned to the right.

There is also a search bar on the top to filter through messages by username.  Simply begin typing the username in question, and the app will do the rest:

To log out, click the button on the top of the Chat Page, which will also redirect you to the Login Page.
